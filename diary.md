day 6

idea for "scaling up attacks", basiaclly a roguelike but gridbased. done some gridbased stuff before and I liked it.

day 7

moved over some gridbased stuff from `convenience`. got grid generation and actor movement started. dove deep into smooth camera scrolling and _almost_ got it working. it looks better but not the best

day 8

got some smooth scrolling semi-solutions out of the way. the main smooth camera scrolling solution didn't work. shit is annoying but there's not always a perfect way to do things, sometimes its just A Way.

Bought the [oryx ultimate roguelike tileset](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/products/ultimate-roguelike-tileset) for $5!

Got a little more done after work, packed and got ready to fly tomorrow.
