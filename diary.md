## day 6

idea for "scaling up attacks", basiaclly a roguelike but gridbased. done some gridbased stuff before and I liked it.

## day 7

moved over some grid based stuff from `convenience`. got grid generation and actor movement started. dove deep into smooth camera scrolling and _almost_ got it working. it looks better but not the best

## day 8

got some smooth scrolling semi-solutions out of the way. the main smooth camera scrolling solution didn't work. shit is annoying but there's not always a perfect way to do things, sometimes its just A Way.

Bought the [oryx ultimate roguelike tileset](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/products/ultimate-roguelike-tileset) for $5!

Got a little more done after work, packed and got ready to fly tomorrow.

## day 9

flew and traveled all day. worked on adding elements and code restructuring a bit on the plane.

## day 10

hung out with folks, listened to Brian Eno, walked the dog and coded. A lot on code restructure and getting the game in a good place to iterate. This early stage is a challenge because of how "wide" I am going, accounting for many things from the beginning.

Stumpted for a while on simple math.

Definitely going to be a challenge to get this done.

Just starting on dungeon generation.

## day 11

wedding, no coding today! good day.
