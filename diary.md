## day 6

idea for "scaling up attacks", basiaclly a roguelike but gridbased. done some gridbased stuff before and I liked it.

## day 7

moved over some grid based stuff from `convenience`. got grid generation and actor movement started. dove deep into smooth camera scrolling and _almost_ got it working. it looks better but not the best

## day 8

got some smooth scrolling semi-solutions out of the way. the main smooth camera scrolling solution didn't work. shit is annoying but there's not always a perfect way to do things, sometimes its just A Way.

Bought the [oryx ultimate roguelike tileset](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/products/ultimate-roguelike-tileset) for $5!

Got a little more done after work, packed and got ready to fly tomorrow.

## day 9

flew and traveled all day. worked on adding elements and code restructuring a bit on the plane.

## day 10

hung out with folks, listened to Brian Eno, walked the dog and coded. A lot on code restructure and getting the game in a good place to iterate. This early stage is a challenge because of how "wide" I am going, accounting for many things from the beginning.

Stumped for a while on simple math.

Definitely going to be a challenge to get this done.

Just starting on dungeon generation.

## day 11

wedding, no coding today! good day.

## day 12

long travel day. got a little bit of work done, started looking into dungeon generation. going to be more of a challenge than i thought.

## day 13

back to work. room generation took a bit of time. finally got some stuff working, but it's going to be a challenging process for this entire game.

## day 14

busy day at work. was able to get room gen looking okay, now it's just a bit boring. need it to generate an ok or better level _every_ time, so it's working in that regard. getting close to something playable.

## day 15

i need to get something playable, month is half over at EOD. i have a full week off next week, so i'll need this game 99% done at the end of that. if i can get the game to a fun point by the end of this work week, i'll be in great shape.

you can now shoot fireballs and get bit by rats. it's taken a long time to get to this point but hopefully development accelerates for the second half of the month.

# day 16

just found out that if I finish this, it will be my 20th game (i don't show all of my finished games prominently)

i also just checked my todo list and it is fucking huge.

also also just realized today i want to quit my day job.

anyways, development is starting to get interesting. After going through some combat, i've realized how obtuse the movement is. maybe tiles should be a tad bigger? it's also been interesting because the systems are starting to feel solid. A snake bites a rat when it tries to bite me, now the rat is trying to attack the snake instead of me. I can sub out attacks for any actor and they'll work iterchangably. adding content is pretty simple and straightforward.

# day 17

busy day at work, met up with friends after work. not much time to program.

# day 18

think i'm going to take it easy this weekend. longer breaks, gotta run some errands. going to go ham this week (hopefully).

went for a couple walks, did a little bit with ui and dungeon generation. met up with some friends again.

# day 19

cleaned the apartment today, hung out a bit. got caught up on some stupid math. really tired of this screen jitter. switched some stuff up so it's not so bad. elected to lay around today more than normal so i'm a bit behind.

# day 20

the stretch before the home stretch. the time where I need to get everything done. today was tough, really thought i would be further along. i guess thats game dev.

also scavengers reign is sick.

# day 21

started off spending too much time working on "retreat" tech. might be working too hard, keep getting caught on dumb bugs. still making some progress, starting to feel fun. it's also hectic, i guess i've never really made a roguelike before.

## day 22

the more i do the more i realize i need to do

## day 23

happy thanksgiving

## day 24

happy day after thanksgiving, not much done.

## day 25

under a week remains. i need this to be fully playable this weekend in order to finish it by the deadline. friends are in town so we'll see.

## day 26

saw some friends. don't love this game, i guess it's publishable for a jam. it came out too obtuse and hard to handle. maybe with some particles and sound it will turn out ok, i'm afraid that's going to make it more janky.
