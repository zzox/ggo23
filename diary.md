## day 6

idea for "scaling up attacks", basiaclly a roguelike but gridbased. done some gridbased stuff before and I liked it.

## day 7

moved over some grid based stuff from `convenience`. got grid generation and actor movement started. dove deep into smooth camera scrolling and _almost_ got it working. it looks better but not the best

## day 8

got some smooth scrolling semi-solutions out of the way. the main smooth camera scrolling solution didn't work. shit is annoying but there's not always a perfect way to do things, sometimes its just A Way.

Bought the [oryx ultimate roguelike tileset](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/products/ultimate-roguelike-tileset) for $5!

Got a little more done after work, packed and got ready to fly tomorrow.

## day 9

flew and traveled all day. worked on adding elements and code restructuring a bit on the plane.

## day 10

hung out with folks, listened to Brian Eno, walked the dog and coded. A lot on code restructure and getting the game in a good place to iterate. This early stage is a challenge because of how "wide" I am going, accounting for many things from the beginning.

Stumped for a while on simple math.

Definitely going to be a challenge to get this done.

Just starting on dungeon generation.

## day 11

wedding, no coding today! good day.

## day 12

long travel day. got a little bit of work done, started looking into dungeon generation. going to be more of a challenge than i thought.

## day 13

back to work. room generation took a bit of time. finally got some stuff working, but it's going to be a challenging process for this entire game.

## day 14

busy day at work. was able to get room gen looking okay, now it's just a bit boring. need it to generate an ok or better level _every_ time, so it's working in that regard. getting close to something playable.

## day 15

i need to get something playable, month is half over at EOD. i have a full week off next week, so i'll need this game 99% done at the end of that. if i can get the game to a fun point by the end of this work week, i'll be in great shape.

you can now shoot fireballs and get bit by rats. it's taken a long time to get to this point but hopefully development accelerates for the second half of the month.

# day 16

just found out that if I finish this, it will be my 20th game (i don't show all of my finished games prominently)

i also just checked my todo list and it is fucking huge.

also also just realized today i want to quit my day job.

anyways, development is starting to get interesting. After going through some combat, i've realized how obtuse the movement is. maybe tiles should be a tad bigger? it's also been interesting because the systems are starting to feel solid. A snake bites a rat when it tries to bite me, now the rat is trying to attack the snake instead of me. I can sub out attacks for any actor and they'll work iterchangably. adding content is pretty simple and straightforward.
